## The Ultimate Heavy-Duty Access Solution

Engineered for extreme loads and sensitive environments, **DURA-BASE® Composite Mats** allow you to operate heavy machinery on soft ground without bogging, rutting, or causing environmental damage. Whether you are dealing with wetlands, loose sand, or tidal zones, Dura-Base provides a stable, continuous work surface.

### Why Choose Dura-Base?

#### 1. Patented Interlocking Safety
Safety is non-negotiable. Dura-Base features a **patented twist-lock connection system** that securely joins mats together with a single turn. This overlapping lip design creates a sealed, continuous surface that eliminates differential movement, tripping hazards, and gapping—problems common with traditional timber mats.

#### 2. Superior Load Distribution
Don't let soft ground stop your project. These mats are designed to support compressive loads in excess of **600 psi (42 kg/cm²)**. They distribute weight effectively across the substrate, preventing equipment from sinking and ensuring a stable platform for cranes, piling rigs, and heavy haulers.

#### 3. Environmental Stewardship
Protect the land you work on.
*   **100% Recyclable:** Made from High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE).
*   **Non-Absorbent:** Won't soak up contaminants, water, or invasive biological species. Easy to clean and decontaminate.
*   **Ground Protection:** The mats "float" over the surface, minimizing soil compaction and root damage. Once removed, the site often requires zero remediation.

#### 4. Logistics & Cost Efficiency
Do more with less. Lighter and thinner than timber or concrete alternatives, we can load **46 mats (approx. 380m²)** onto a single truck. This significantly reduces transportation costs and carbon footprint, making your logistics simpler and greener.
