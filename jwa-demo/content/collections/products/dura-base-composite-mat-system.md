**The ultimate heavy-duty solution for temporary roads and working platforms.**

Engineered for extreme loads and sensitive environments, DURA-BASE® mats allow you to operate heavy machinery on soft ground without bogging, rutting, or environmental damage.

### Key Specifications
*   **Load Capacity:** 600 psi (42 kg/cm²)
*   **Dimensions:** 2.44m x 4.27m
*   **Weight:** 454kg per mat
*   **Material:** High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE)

### Why Choose DURA-BASE?

1.  **Interlocking Safety:** The patented twist-lock connection system creates a continuous surface, eliminating the tripping hazards and gapping common with timber mats.
2.  **Logistics Savings:** Lighter and thinner than concrete or timber, we can fit **46 mats (380m²)** on a single truck, drastically reducing transport costs.
3.  **Zero Remediation:** The mats "float" over the surface. Once removed, the ground underneath remains undisturbed, eliminating the need for expensive soil rehabilitation.
4.  **All-Weather Access:** UV-stabilised and static-dissipative, these mats perform in torrential rain and scorching heat where other solutions fail.

**Ideal for:** Crane pads, piling rig access, pipeline construction, and environmentally sensitive zones.
